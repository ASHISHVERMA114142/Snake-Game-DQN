# Introduction 
This Project is based on Reinforcement Learning which trains the snake to eat the food present in the environment.

In snake game, inputs will be the position of the snake or the head of the snake and the
position of the food, so according to these inputs our agent will apply a Q-learning model with a
neural network and give the best possible move at that particular moment.

# Three Module:
1 The Environment (the game that we build) 
2 The Model (Reinforcement model for move prediction)
3 The Agent (Intermediary between Environment and Model)
